                    <p>Hi there! My name is Noah, and I'm a IT professional with a specialization in programming. I'm
                        passionate about automation and gardening and I love using my skills to create programs and applications
                        that can be used in any capacity.</p>

                    <p>My journey into programming and IT began when I was young and discovered my fascination with
                        technology through playing games on my grandparents' computer. Since then,
                        I've solved, created, and managed web pages, applications, bugs, and a small business, For example:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Remodeled a more efficient database for patient records used in real world operations</li>
                        <li>Managed a small retail store</li>
                        <!-- <li>experience/accomplishment 3</li>
                        <li>experience/accomplishment 4</li> -->
                    </ul>

                    <p>These experiences have taught me how to analyze data and identify areas of improvement, inventory and financial management, 
                        as well as staff training and supervision; and have helped me
                        develop adaptability, leadership, stragetic thinking, and patience.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not doing school or working a trade job, you can usually find me gaming online, gardening, listening to music
                        or spending time with friends and family. Some of my hobbies
                        include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Gardening</li>
                        <li>Computer Hardware Hobbist </li>
                        <li>Gaming</li>
                        <!-- <li>hobby 4</li> -->
                    </ul>

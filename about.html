                    <p>Hi there! My name is Noah, and I'm a IT professional with a specialization in programming. I'm
                        passionate about automation and gardening and I love using my skills to create automated systems
                        that can be used in any gardening capacity.</p>

                    <p>My journey into programming and IT began when I was young and discovered my fascination with
                        technology through playing games on my grandparents' computer. Since then,
                        I've solved and created web pages, applications, bugs and a working database for patient info
                        for a business, [list some of your experiences and accomplishments that are relevant to your
                        profession/field]. For example:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>experience/accomplishment 1</li>
                        <li>experience/accomplishment 2</li>
                        <li>experience/accomplishment 3</li>
                        <li>experience/accomplishment 4</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These experiences have taught me how to problem solve in fast environments [what you've learned
                        from your experiences], and have helped me
                        develop [what skills or qualities you've developed].</p>

                    <p>When I'm not doing school work and , you can usually find me [what you like to do
                        in your free time], or spending time with [who you like to spend time with]. Some of my hobbies
                        include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>hobby 1</li>
                        <li>hobby 2</li>
                        <li>hobby 3</li>
                        <li>hobby 4</li>
                    </ul>
